"""
A script for real-world testing of audio capture and playback.

This script allows you to:
1. Record audio from your microphone and save it to a file.
2. Play an audio file through your speakers.

This helps verify that the core audio components are working correctly
with your system's audio devices, including virtual ones like BlackHole.
